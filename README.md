# Muffin Tools - Public documentation

**This documentation refers the Muffin Tools library, which is not accessible to public for now, but soon !** :)

This library contains tools, assets and utilities for Unity projects.

It's composed of "modules" that you can import separately in your projects. Only exception for the **Core** module, which is sometimes used in other Muffin Tools' modules, and so is required to make other modules work properly.
